Package: RNAmaps
Title: Visualise Intersections of Genomic Intervals
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Jack", "Humphrey", email = "jack.humphrey@ucl.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Using a system call to bedtools, RNAmaps intersects two sets of genomic coordinates where one set set encompasses the other.
    Each interval can then be scaled to a uniform length and the proportional coverage is calculated.
    Pretty density plots can then be made.
